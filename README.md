# NeuroLearn
Helping neurodivergent students with personalized learning tools and support.

📌 **Problem Statement**  
**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI Magic with Groq**

🎯 **Objective**  
NeuroLearn addresses the challenges faced by neurodivergent students in traditional learning environments. It serves students by offering adaptive curricula, program tracking, and community support, using AI to create personalized study plans, track progress, and provide accessibility tools such as text-to-speech and speech-to-text. This project aims to create a more inclusive and effective learning experience for neurodivergent students.
